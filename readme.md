<p>
    I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for writing clean and well structured code. My passion for writing code began around 1997 with the exploration of PHP. Around 2014 I defined Go as my preferred language. I enjoy trying out new languages and over the years I've written code in a lot of them; Go, PHP, V, Python, Ruby, Crystal, C and many more.
