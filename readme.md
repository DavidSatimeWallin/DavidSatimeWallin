<p>
    I am a huge language-nerd. I Started coding in 1998 but since 2014 my main interest lies in Go. In my spare time I like to dig into languages like python, ruby, crystal, zig, and many others. I am still passionate about learning new languages and techniques.  Besides my hands-on experience, I have enjoyed build and managing international, as well as local, software teams. I prefer working in a product company and make an impact with my work.
